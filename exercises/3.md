## 3. Setup multiple environments staging & production

As our configuration changes move through our continuous delivery pipeline we want to be able to run tests against our changes on real Fastly infrastructure before finally applying them to production. 

A common approach to facilitate this is to have multiple mirrored environments `test`, `staging`, and `production`. Ideally the configuration would be the same for each environment and only features such as what _origin host_ or _connection credentials_ change from one environment to another.

By storing all of our configuration in source control, we are trying to ensure that can automatically reproduce services and environments at will.

Fortunately with the use of `variables` and `modules`, Terraform allows us to abstract environment specific state from our base configuration. This paired with the Travis build lifecycle we can produce a continuous deployment pipeline to move our changes through each environment.

### 3.1 Abstract state into variables
Open up our `terraform/main.tf` file from the first exercise and review the configuration to identify the properties that we want to be configurable on a per environment basis. 

Will the domain name be the same for your staging environment? Or what backend host? What else might change?


```hcl
variable "fastly_api_token" {
    type = "string"
}

provider "fastly" {
  api_key = "${var.fastly_api_token}"
}

resource "fastly_service_v1" "service" {
  name = "my-altitude-service"

  force_destroy = true

  domain {
    name    = "my-altitude-service.fastly-altitude-2017.com"
    comment = "Demo domain"
  }

  backend {
    address               = "storage.googleapis.com"
    ssl_hostname          = "altitude-nyc-abcd-2017-stage.storage.googleapis.com"
    name                  = "altitude-nyc-abcd-2017-stage"
    port                  = 443
    first_byte_timeout    = 3000
    max_conn              = 200
    between_bytes_timeout = 1000
  }

  header {
    name        = "backend-host-override"
    action      = "set"
    type        = "request"
    destination = "http.Host"
    source      = "\"altitude-nyc-abcd-2017-stage.storage.googleapis.com\""
  }
}
```

The properties we've identified to be useful between services are:
- `name` We can't override the production service every time, so we must create a new one.
- `domain.name` we need to be able to address the staging service separately
- `backend.hostname` We need to connect to a different storage bucket or server to allow us to also test changes to our application.

Now that we've identified the configuration state we need to abstract them into variables so we can pass the values in via the CLI. Have a go at converting these values into Terraform variables, just like we did with the `fastly_api_token` in the first exercise.

Your `main.tf` should end up looking something like this:
```hcl
#Define required variables
variable "fastly_api_token" {}
variable "fastly_name" {}
variable "fastly_domain" {}
variable "fastly_backend_bucket" {}

# Configure Fastly provider
provider "fastly" {
  api_key = "${var.fastly_api_token}"
}

# Define Fastly Service
resource "fastly_service_v1" "service" {
  name = "${var.fastly_name}"

  force_destroy = true

  domain {
    name    = "${var.fastly_domain}"
    comment = "Demo domain"
  }

  backend {
    address               = "storage.googleapis.com"
    ssl_hostname          = "${var.fastly_backend_bucket}.storage.googleapis.com"
    name                  = "${var.fastly_backend_bucket}"
    port                  = 443
    first_byte_timeout    = 3000
    max_conn              = 200
    between_bytes_timeout = 1000
  }

  header {
    name        = "backend-host-override"
    action      = "set"
    type        = "request"
    destination = "http.Host"
    source      = "\"${var.fastly_backend_bucket}.storage.googleapis.com\""
  }
}
```

### 3.2 .tfvars file
Whilst we could pass each new variable we've defined to Terraform via individual `-var` flags to the command, this would become tiresome and potentially increase the chance of configuration drift. Fortunately Terraform allows for variables to be collected into their own [definition file `.tfvars`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-files) and passed all at once using the `-var-file=foo.tfvars` flag.

This allows us to stay with our mantra of configuring everything in code whilst safely separating our staging and production configuration in different files.

To achieve this we can create a `terraform/environments` directory which will contain our environment specific state and a `.tfvars` file for each environment we want to create:

```sh
$ mkdir terraform/environments
$ touch terraform/environments/staging.tfvars
$ touch terraform/environments/production.tfvars
```

Now all we need to do is populate the files with the environment state:

**terraform/environments/staging.tfvars**
```hcl
fastly_name = "<YOUR STAGING SERVICE NAME>"

fastly_domain = "<YOUR STAGING DOMAIN>"

fastly_backend_bucket = "altitude-nyc-abcd-2017-stage"
```

**terraform/environments/production.tfvars**
```hcl
fastly_name = "<YOUR PRODUCTION SERVICE NAME>"

fastly_domain = "<YOUR PRODUCTION DOMAIN>"

fastly_backend_bucket = "altitude-nyc-abcd-2017-stage"
```

> Note:
Variables files use HCL or JSON to define variable values. Strings, lists or maps may be set in the same manner as the default value in a variable block in Terraform configuration. If a file named terraform.tfvars is present in the current directory, Terraform automatically loads it to populate variables. If the file is named something else, you can pass the path to the file using the -var-file flag.

### 3.3 Refactor Travis to deploy each environment
Now all thats left to do is get Travis to deploy the `main.tf` configuration to each of our services passing in the environment state from the `.tfvars` file at each stage.

```
# We require the sudo command
sudo: required
# Cache the Terraform binary after each build to speed up builds
cache:
- directories:
  - "$HOME/terraform"
# Run make install command to fetch Terraform binary
install: make install
# Run Terraform plan
script: terraform plan -var 'fastly_api_token=$FASTLY_API_TOKEN' -var-file=./terraform/environments/staging.tfvars ./terraform
deploy:
# The deploy will be a simple script command
- provider: script
  # don't cleanup the build aretfacts before deployment
  skip_cleanup: true
  # run the terraform apply command
  script: terraform apply -var 'fastly_api_token=$FASTLY_API_TOKEN' -var-file=./terraform/environments/production.tfvar ./terraform
  # only run this deploy step when merging into master
  on:
    branch: master
```

### 3.4 add, commit, push, test
To test our deployment pipeline we need to make a new branch of our repository and push our changes to the `.travis.yml` file.
```sh
$ git checkout -b staging
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m 'Testing Travis CI staging deployment'
$ git push origin staging
```

Raise a new pull request for the branch changes in GitHub and merge it:
```sh
TODO SCREEN SHOTS
```

If you jump back over to travis-ci.com you should now be able to watch the build of the `staging` and `master` branches with our newly added staging deployment step creating the staging environment. 

You should see the `apply` output in the build log:
```sh 
TODO ADD SCREENSHOTS
```

### 2.6 Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
If your configuration was successfully applied via Travis CI you should be able to `curl` your newly created staging service:
```sh 
$ curl -v http://<YOUR STAGING SERVICE DOMAIN>.global.prod.fastly.net/index.html

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 11651
Connection: keep-alive
X-Served-By: cache-lcy1136-LCY
X-Cache: HIT
X-Cache-Hits: 1
```
If you don't believe this you can even login to the Fastly web interface and look at your configuration.
